# Todos API using Actix-Web

This is a small example app written in [actix](https://actix.rs) to support a simple Todo List application.

## Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set up your [database URL](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx#connecting). You won't be able to compile this code without it!

```bash
cargo run
```

Your API should now listen on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
